Additionally, Engineered end-to-end data pipelines from FLAIR/FOCUS through Azure Blob Storage to Power BI, fully automated and built from scratch on greenfield infrastructure with no prior systems to build on.</p><p>My core technical stack — Dash, R, RAG — maps directly to what  University of Central Florida is looking for.
